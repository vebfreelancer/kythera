# Kythera family website
[vebfreelancer.github.io/kythera](https://vebfreelancer.github.io/kythera/dist/index.html)
```
Australian Kythera Association website for finding and posting your family connections.
The assignment was completed under a fixed-price agreement, eleven web pages were
developed.

Layouts of pages for development were presented in Adobe XD, design work was not fully 
completed, unfinished responsive page layouts, hover effects not shown cursor, and others. 
All points are unfinished at the design stage and adaptive has been refined in agreement 
with the client in creating web pages. The final result of the page is completed in full  
with all details taken into account.

An interesting task was the development of a drag-and-drop interface on the new post page.
Several menus are implemented in the project - user authorization, aside, mobile menu, and
search menu on mobile devices. Personal account and pages for creating new posts on the 
website through a personal account.
